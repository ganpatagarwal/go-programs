#### Solution 1: Brute Force
Calculate product of other numbers in the array except the positional element.
It will require 2 for loops.

```
time - O(N*2)
space - O(1)
```

#### Solution 2: Two Pass using division
Calculate product of whole array in 1st pass
During second pass, divide the total product with poistional num to get the
desired product.

```
time - O(N)
space - O(1)
```

#### Solution 3: Two Pass without division

```
time - O(N)
space - O(1)
```
